title: Ping-to-json shell script

My ping-to-json shell script is [here](https://github.com/richardimaoka/ping-to-json). You can do the following:

```plaintext
> git clone 
> ping google.com | ping-to-json/ping-to-json.sh

# You can also use `jq` for better formatting and further processing 
# > ping google.com | ping-to-json/ping-to-json.sh | jq
```

and get the output like below:

```plaintext

where the normal ping output is like:

```plaintext
PING google.com (172.217.26.46) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from nrt12s17-in-f46.1e100.net (172.217.26.46): icmp_seq=1 ttl=57 time=8.69 ms

--- google.com ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 4004ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 7.590/10.362/18.049/3.870 ms
```

## Prerequisite:

`sed` and `awk` are required. 


`jq` is not needed unless you pipe the output to the `jq` command like this:

```plaintext
>ping google.com | ping-to-json/ping-to-json.sh
```

## Why did I write this?

While working on my ping experiment for [my previous article](https://richardimaoka.github.io/blog/network-latency-analysis-with-ping-aws/), I started feeling it will be much more convenient to convert the ping output into a json, for automatic data collection and processing.

I tried to find an existing tool, but surprisingly or not, I could find only one such tool:

https://pypi.org/project/pingparsing/

pingparsing is written in Python, and looked neat and useful. However, I wanted a shell script which has less dependencies so that I can run it on a broader range of environments.

My script is not as mature as pingparsing, so please let me know any case my shell script is not parsing the correct ping output.
