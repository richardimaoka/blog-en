## Overview

You can find the code and instruction to run the example at [GitHub](https://github.com/richardimaoka/resources/tree/master/persistent-actor-minimal).

### receiveCommand

```scala
  override def receiveCommand: Receive = {
    case Command(i) ⇒
      persist(Event(i)) { event ⇒
        sum += i
      }
  }
```

Persistence actor receives a `Command` and generate an `Event`, then persist the `Event` via `Journal`. The `receiveCommand` method of `PersistentActor` does that.

### receiveRecover

```scala
  override def receiveRecover: Receive = {
    case Event(i) ⇒
      sum += i
  }
```

`receiveRecover` is called upon restarting a `PersistentActor` after exception was thrown.

## Instruction to run the example
